# TapMap

This application helps users locate breweries by city or zip code. With a drop down function that will allow the user to search specifically, they are able to search for large breweries, microbreweries, brewpubs, breweries that offer tours, and breweries that are dog friendly. The results will display a map with exact locations, the breweries names and website. 

There is also a section that features ...(a beer pong game created using Javascript, a tap pour game, Grandpa Joe's beer puns). 

The application was designed based on the following criteria:
