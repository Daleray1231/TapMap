# TapMap

This application helps users locate breweries by city or zip code. With a drop down function that will allow the user to search specifically, they are able to search for micro breweries, brewpubs, large breweries, and regional breweries. The results will display a map with exact locations, the breweries names and website. 

The application also introduces the TapMap team and provides the opportunity to contact members if desired. 

The application was designed based on the following criteria: 
- An easy to navigate, interactive display that allows users locate breweries
- Allows users to input desired locations and brewery types 
- Displays search results on a map and provides a listing of brewery names with addresses and websites
- Stores history based on 5 previous searches and easily cleared as the user desires
- Display is responsive based on device type
- Integrates use of 3 APIs for managing search data
